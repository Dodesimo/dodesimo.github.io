This project was built out of necessity.

When studying for my computer architecture final, I needed a way to efficiently memory some information.

However, **everything on the market sucked.** Quizlet was pay-walled, Anki has a unintuitive UI.

My friends also faced this issue, so I built Tofee.

In this project, I:
 
 - Developed a full-stack AI study tool with **React** and **FastAPI** that converts documents into quizzes and flashcards
- Designed five API endpoints to convert PDFs, plaintext, and YouTube transcripts into JSON-formatted quiz questions using **Google Gemini Flash** and **regex**, deployed on **Vercel**
- Used **Firestore** to save user sessions and **100+** generated flashcards across MCQ, T/F, and FITB quiz formats
