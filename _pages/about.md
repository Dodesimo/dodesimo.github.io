Hi! My name is Devam, and I'm a student studying computer science at Georgia Tech.

I'm experienced in **backend and full-stack development, as well as AI engineering.** 

I'm also curious and interested in **low-latency development and AI infrastructure** 

In terms of industry experience, I have interned at:
* [**whiz.ai**](https://www.iqvia.com/locations/united-states/solutions/life-sciences/information-solutions/business-intelligence-and-analytics/) (acquired by **IQVIA**), building a system that selects optimal exploratory data analysis algorithms from natural-language queries.
* [**InPharmD**](https://inpharmd.com/our_story) (**Y Combinator W21**), developing a deep-research literature review algorithm for drug diagnosis used by clinical pharmacists nationwide.
* [**Cisco**](https://www.cisco.com/site/us/en/products/security/secure-email/index.html), working on the **Email Threat Defense Team** to prototype Google message remediation and productionize bulk Outlook message remediation and reclassification.

This summer, I will be interning at [**Millennium Management**](https://www.mlp.com/) in the **Equities IT** group, working on **latency-critical technology**, and this fall, I'll be interning at [**Amazon Web Services (AWS)**](https://www.aws.amazon.com) working on **networking infrastructure**. 

In terms of academia, I have worked with:
* [**Dr. Carlo Lipizzi**](https://www.stevens.edu/profile/clipizzi), developing dataset-augmentation methods to reduce bias in LLMs and graph-based techniques to identify LLM training data sources.
* [**Dr. Binfeng Lu**](https://www.hmh-cdi.org/en/research/faculty/binfeng-lu), building RAG-based systems to automate RNA sequencing and differential analysis at the **Center for Discovery and Innovation @ Hackensack Meridian Health**.
* [**Dr. Patrick Kastner**](https://arch.gatech.edu/people/patrick-kastner), creating simulations to study the impact of gentrification along the Atlanta Beltline.
* [**Dr. Munmun De Choudhury**](http://www.munmund.net/), developing a production-ready system for adolescent mental health monitoring for use at **Children’s Healthcare of Atlanta**.

As you can see, **I enjoy wearing a bunch of hats.**
